# Bild-an-Eletronic-Speed-Controller-
This project aims to outline an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) using KiCad, simulate its behavior with LTspice, and study its electronic fundamentals. Based on this, a PCB will be designed and an ESP32 will be used for control purposes.

## 1 Materials
-controller: ESP32-S3
-6 Mosfets 
-Drive Gate
-resistor pull-down 
-2 capcitor bypass
-1 capacitor bootstrap 
-1 Diodo Bootstrap

## 2 theoretical fundamentals
